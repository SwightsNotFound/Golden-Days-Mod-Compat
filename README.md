The goal of this resource pack is to re-texture many popular mods so they visually match the **Golden Days** aesthetic.

Make sure Golden Days Mod Compat is above Golden Days on the resource pack screen.

### Notes / Known Issues

Variant chests are not supported, so I recommend that if you’re playing with Quirk, you simply turn them off (`QuirkSettings/Building/Variant chests = false`). BetterEnd unfortunately does not have a toggle, so you would need to use something like [CraftTweaker](https://modrinth.com/mod/crafttweaker) to remove the recipes. You may also need to hide the recipes in your recipe viewer if you have one installed.

Currently, custom item models for pressure plates and fence gates do not work on 1.21.4+. I will fix this at some point.

Custom beta-style boat textures used by Golden Days through EMF are not currently supported for modded boats. This is mainly because I don’t fully understand how EMF works, but also Golden Days’ implementation can cause some visual glitches on older versions. For those reasons, this resource pack disables Golden Days’ custom boats by default. You can toggle this option in [Respackopts](https://modrinth.com/mod/respackopts).
